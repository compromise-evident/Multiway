/* Multiway log



Version 1       "How to run the program" has been improved again (can still be slapped
                into any .cpp file so the new users need not shuffle for answers.)

Origin          Was looking for the best possible encryption method which led me to
                the accidental re-discovery of the One-time pad (unbreakable.)
                However, even that felt limiting as one-time privately-shared keys
                is impractical. This led me to prove that P!=NP shortly after by
                reusing and symmetrically transforming OTP keys. Now I was satisfied
                with having found something free from reversal shortcuts. And after
                incorporating this--what I interchangeably call a step-down and
                multi-way function into CSC (hence the renaming  from CSC to Authorship,)
                I had written a handful of OTPs (currently only 2 are published and
                heavily rewritten/improved.) These OTPs range from 79-character messages
                to file multi-key distribution among groups where keys are useless unless
                you have them all. Finally, the cryptography community calls for a
                multi-way function implementation with keys you can remember-- unlike
                the 12,000-digit multi-way functions in my 6-year baby--Authorship. */
